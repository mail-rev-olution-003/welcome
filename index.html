<p>It has been  great spending these few months with you in Alliance Francaise. As you won't be joining us for the next session, I thought of giving you those bracelets to remind you at all times that you have found yourself a brother who is always there to see you succeed.Buttercup is a yellow flower that connotes happiness and warmth.
    You embody those characteristics, the reason I named you that. Phoebe, you have the potential to do a lot of things that will impact the world positively. Within these few months, I have realised you are a problem solver with a high level of creativity. You also love to help people, explore more and learn more about yourself, but in the end, you restrict yourself because of a little fear and shyness in you that holds you back.
    You are filled with boldness and a light that brightens every darkness. Let that light shine, let not fear and shyness cast a shadow on the boldness inside you. I pray God guides you to explore the right things for you to achieve the purpose he has for you. I will be he here at all times if you need to talk, share ideas, cry, find solutions or whatever the case may be. Do not hesitate to give me a call or drop a text.  I will be rehearsing to be an MC at your wedding. Guard your heart and your mind that you will not fall prey to the camouflages that will appear as your husband. You deserve a man who loves God not a boy who loves the world.
    And hey, we will have a car race one day, do not forget that. All the best.
    May God continue to bless you</p>
